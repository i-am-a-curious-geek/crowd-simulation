# crowd-simulation
No DB set up. Pure frontend web application. Enables user to view crowd simulations with leaflet map API and also to draw and edit objects (e.g. polylines, polygons) and plot markers on the map. Drawn objects can subsequently be saved as a GeoJson into a text file.

# Note
Crowd simulation is based in Singapore and project is still in progress. Charts will be added and toggled via the half-completed menu on the home.html page at the moment. Design of web app is mobile, iPad and desktop responsive.
